# AdVenture Capitalist session July 3rd 2021

I played for a shorter duration today, and made some progress.

## Earth

I made some progress on Earth today.

## Moon

I made very minor progress on the moon today. I did a moon reset and got close to where I originally was. I am not getting enough angel investors to increase the speed.

## Mars

I made some progress on Mars today, finding out that there were Angel upgrades I missed, and doing tons of industry purchases.

## 1 percent land Event

I briefly played the event today, so that I could get the gold, but nothing else. I was going to do the 6 year anniversary event, when I found out it isn't playable, and is just a set of deals.

## Overview

See above.
