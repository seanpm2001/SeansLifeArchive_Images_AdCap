# AdVenture Capitalist session June 19th 2021

I played for a shorter duration today, and made some progress, doing resets on both Earth and Mars.

## Earth

I made lots of progress on Earth today, doing an angel claim, and getting myself up past where I originally was.

## Moon

I made very minor progress on the moon today. I decided not to do a reset today.

## Mars

I made some progress on Mars today, doing an angel claim, and getting myself up far past where I originally was.

## Saturday Morning Cartoon Fever Event

I briefly played the event today, so that I could get the gold, and was going to get another cartoon badge, but just didn't have the time.

## Overview

See above.
