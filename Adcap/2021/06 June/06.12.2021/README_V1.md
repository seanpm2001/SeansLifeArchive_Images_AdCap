# AdVenture Capitalist session June 12th 2021

I played for a while today, and made some progress, with several hundred upgrades on Earth.

## Earth

I made some progress with upgrades on Earth, doing collection, and getting to the point where I couldn't afford anything before moving on.

## Moon

I made very minor progress on the moon today.

## Mars

I made some progress on Mars today, doing a couple hundred upgrades.

## Cashalot Event

I briefly played the event today, so that I could get the gold, and another Cashalot badge, now having a power level of 3 out of 30. I also made minor progress to possibly qualify for rank 9 or 8.

## Overview

See above.
