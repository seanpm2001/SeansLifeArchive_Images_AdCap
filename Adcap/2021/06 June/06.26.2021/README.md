# AdVenture Capitalist session June 26th 2021

I played for a shorter duration today, and made some progress.

## Earth

I made some progress on Earth today.

## Moon

I made very minor progress on the moon today. I decided not to do a reset again today.

## Mars

I made some progress on Mars today, finding out that there were Angel upgrades I missed, and doing tons of industry purchases.

## Profit-a-bowl Event

I briefly played the event today, so that I could get the gold, an additional badge, and a time warp express to make up for the one I used earlier. I didn't achieve the 3rd goal.

## Overview

See above.
