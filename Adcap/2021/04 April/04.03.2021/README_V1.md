# AdVenture Capitalist session - April 3rd 2021

I had a short AdVenture Capitalist session today, but made some progress.

## Earth

I did collection from Earth, maxed out the ad boost, and did an angel claim. I brought everything back up past what it was before before I transitioned to the next planet.

## Moon

I did the usual collection from the moon today, and also did an angel claim that really didn't make too much progress. I am wondering how people even max out their revenue on the moon.

## Mars

I did minor collection from Mars today and used the profit boost.

## Making it rain event

I played the event for a while today, but didn't let it get too excessive. I didn't make it very far in the event.

## Overall

I kept the session short today and made minor progress. I briefly played in the event and did an angel claim on Earth and the Moon, but not mars.
