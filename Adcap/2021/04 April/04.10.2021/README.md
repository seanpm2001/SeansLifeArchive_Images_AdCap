# AdVenture Capitalist session April 10th 2021

I had a long, and distracted session today. I made some progress, but I spent lots of time trying to get my file services to work and later trying to find a functional SD card, so my session was sporatic, and I took many long and random breaks.

## Earth

I made some progress on Earth, doing the usual collection, and getting enough profits for a good angel boost. I also watched 12 ads for boosts and a reward of 3 gold.

## Moon

I made insignificant progress on the moon today. I considered doing an angel claim, as it is the only way to make even a tiny amount of progress now, but it didn't feel ready. I intend to do weekly moon resets soon.

## Mars

I made some progress on mars today and did an angel claim. I will make much more progress on next weeks session as well.

## Event

I joined the event and collected the gold, but nothing more. I considered equipping the event booster for some points, but I didn't have time to keep playing.

## Other

During my search for a functional pCloud/Degoo account, I found some old AdVenture Capitalist and AdVenture Communist data from August and September 2020. I re-uploaded some of it today.
