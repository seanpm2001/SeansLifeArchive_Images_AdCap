# AdCap session - March 27th 2021

The game was functional today, I don't know what happened last week. I played for a bit, but limited myself, as this game is now a known addiction.

## Earth

The game seemed to be able to load today, I was able to do collection on Earth and make some progress.

## Moon

Just a quick stop to throw money at businesses, it is really hard to progress at this point, but I am trying to fully max out the moon (and reach the maximum amount of cash)

## Mars

I made some progress on Mars today, with 2 weeks of offline revenue. I am getting ready to claim angels here again.

## Profit-a-bowl event

I tried to just claim the gold from the event today, but I got sucked in and played for a long time. I managed to get out on time.
