# AdVenture Capitalist session May 15th 2021

I played for a while today, and made some progress, especially on Mars, where I did an angel claim today.

## Earth

I made some progress with upgrades on Earth, doing over 20 upgrades. I am still saving up angels for the next angel claim. I am getting very close to the point where it isn't playable without an angel claim or some boost.

## Moon

I made very minor progress on the moon today.

## Mars

I made lots of progress on Mars today, doing an angel claim, and tens of thousands of upgrades.

## Profit-A-Bowl Event

I briefly played the event today, so that I could get the gold, but nothing else this time, as I wasn't interested, and was very low on time.

## Overview

See above.
