# AdVenture Capitalist session May 1st 2021

I was unable to play today, as my phone was refusing to install the latest update, which is required to play. I tried updating through the app, closing everything down and updating it manually, then the same process over mobile data, but it just got stuck pending, so I couldn't play today. It at least gives me more time.
